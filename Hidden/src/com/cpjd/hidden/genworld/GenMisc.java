	/*
	 * Gen misc generates some smaller things to add a bit more depth to the world. Here's a list:
	 * 
	 * The agency headquarters - For The Fall of the Agency questline, the agency headquarters is simply a very small hidden entrance
	 * that spawns somewhere on the map, entering it takes the player to the hq of the Agency, where they might learn the backstory of it
	 * 
	 * Geocahces - some small chests with various things to get
	 * 
	 * Sinkholes - better watch out! falling in causes you to lost some of your hard earned money :(
	 * 
	 * Zacharias White's Shack - Zacharias White was once a respectful buisness man but was sabotauged by the Agency. He now stays
	 * hidden in his forest shack. Zacharias White will give you help for the fall of the agency questline - but side with the agency -
	 * you might want to stay away
	 * 
	 * Grave stones - Allow you to learn somethings about past explorers and such
	 * 
	 *
