	/* Here's how village generation will work:
	 * -There will be about 4 - 6 villages generated per map, at random locations
	 * -Villages will include the following:
	 * Blacksmith station
	 * Electronic crafting station
	 * Work station
	 * several houses
	 * Roads
	 * Chests with some randomly generated resources
	 * Shops - carpentry, armory, gear
	 * Research center
	 * And support the spawning of the following:
	 * -NPCs (for trading) - blacksmiths, carpenters, electronic engineers
	 * -Village creatures - during night time, they will attack so - so stay alert!
	 * 
	 * Villages are essentially a way to research new technologies, buy new technologies, and optain, trade, or buy stuff, and get objectives
	 * Villagers might give you information / jobs to do at prisons - they might give you rewords for recusing their relatives - at the
	 * cost of upsetting the agency.
	 * 
	 * This are the 6 villages names that could be used (adjust as neccessary)
	 * -Bradford, Ellwood, Brares, Foxcroft, Town of Ender, Overwood
