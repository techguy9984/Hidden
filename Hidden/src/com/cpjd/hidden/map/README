Cascade Engine Design

Welcome to the design document for the new engine, Cascade.

We kinda needed a rewrite because our old engine was a little poopy for the in-depth calculations we need.

Coordinate Systems
-Pixel - Each pixel is a coordinate
-Tile - Each tile is a coordinate

Here's the basics:

1) All calculations, operations, movement, collision, etc, will be performed on an unscaled image. After all the game stuff is done, we'll draw the image to the screen scaled by 400%.
2) You'll notice that if you resize the screen, the aspect ratio becomes distorted, instead, this engine will crop off the edges if we change the aspect ratio
3) I've got a new design specification for this game, every class (related to game mechanics) should have a .release() method that sets all objects to null and releases any sounds it was using, etc.
4) Most of our code will stay the same, however, the TileMap, Tile, and Entity class will be rewritten to fit the new engine.
5) Put bugs, todo, etc, down here:


	I thought that I would list some of the major TODOs, even though they are obvious

	1) Prison loading (from the open world)
	2) Enemies (both people and fixed [cams, etc])
	3) Interaction with environment (building?, trading?, buying stuff, etc)
	4) better/more graphics
