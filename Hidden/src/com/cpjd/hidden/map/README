Cascade Engine Design

DESIGN
-The final open world map size of the game will be 500 x 500 tiles. On my computer, this takes about a minute to calculate,
here's the reason why I think we can get away with it - a) procedural generation isn't really worth our time, we should spend time
working on the mechanics, and our world isn't infinite so procedural generation isn't required b) the generation can be coded for
more optimization / use of more threads c) we can entertain the user with some silly text story or animation / a minigame - this would actually
be kinda fun I think

TODO
-UI should be scaled down when the screen is resized
-All that's left for world generation: Prisons, Villages, some more organic things in standard terrain generation
-Faster world generation so that we can do 500 x 500 tiles more quickly

BUGS
I can't reproduce these bugs with any screen size of orientation, you'll have to figure out why there're happening on your mac:
-"Cats Pajamas Developers" displays partially off right edge of screen in intro
-"Generating Terrain" displays partially off right edge of screen while loading
-player slows down when holding 'w then s' or 'a then d', but not 's then w' of 'd then a'
-Console vertical position doesn't change with screen resize
-Pause menu opens laggily when fullscreen

Some storyline stuff
-Throughout the story, you learn of the corruptness of the agency, if you choose, you can try to destroy them

VERSIONS
1.50 - Semistable - added collision, error log
1.51 - Semistable - sound fixed in temporary way (slow)
1.60 - Bug fixes related to sound, spawning, and more - Stable
1.61 - Bug fixes related to collision, movement - Stable
1.62 - Major update to console - Stable

VERSION 2.0 TODO
Here's what we should get done for version 2.0
-Terrain / structure generation done
-All known bugs fixed
-Optimization of terrain gen.
-Scaling of the menu


VERSION SEMANTICS
Example 1.43 - Stable

The ones place (in this case = 1) should be changed when a large update or new system is added - for example, adding village generation, or an items system
The 10ths place (in this case = 4) should be changed when a considerable amount of tweaks / fixes have been done, a.k.a 5 or more bug fixes and tweaks
The 100ths place (in this case = 3) should be changed when a few bug fixes or tweaks happened

Versions with the same 1s place should always be compatible, but different can be incompatible. After the game is released, versions should be carefully considered as to whether they will
break existing features

Add the -Stable or Unstable tag based off whether the application is working and completely functional, or there are serious bugs / unfinished features that you're in the middle of.
This is so we know what to expect if it's labeled as stable.
