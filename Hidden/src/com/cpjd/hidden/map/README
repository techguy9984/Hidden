Cascade Engine Design

DESIGN
-The final open world map size of the game will be 500 x 500 tiles. On my computer, this takes about a minute to calculate,
here's the reason why I think we can get away with it - a) procedural generation isn't really worth our time, we should spend time
working on the mechanics, and our world isn't infinite so procedural generation isn't required b) the generation can be coded for
more optimization / use of more threads c) we can entertain the user with some silly text story or animation / a minigame - this would actually
be kinda fun I think

BUGS
<<<<<<< Upstream, based on branch 'master' of https://github.com/techguy9984/Hidden
-prisons spawn on top of each other
-"Cats Pajamas Developers" displays partially off right edge of screen in intro
-"Generating Terrain" displays partially off right edge of screen while loading
-player slows down when holding 'w then s' or 'a then d', but not 's then w' of 'd then a'
=======
-Collision doesn't work when moving diagonally through blocks (here's an example 0 - no collision, 1 - collision, p = player)
0 0 0 0
0 P 1 0
0 1 D 0
0 0 0 0
In this scenario, the player could move between the two collision blocks to d (non-collision) without being stopped.
-Player can walk in the option direction that the player image is pointing

VERSION SEMANTICS
Example 1.43 - Stable

The ones place (in this case = 1) should be changed when a large update or new system is added - for example, adding village generation, or an items system
The 10ths place (in this case = 4) should be changed when a considerable amount of tweaks / fixes have been done, a.k.a 5 or more bug fixes and tweaks
The 100ths place (in this case = 3) should be changed when a few bug fixes or tweaks happened

Versions with the same 1s place should always be compatible, but different can be incompatible. After the game is released, versions should be carefully considered as to whether they will
break existing features

Add the -Stable or Unstable tag based off whether the application is working and completely functional, or there are serious bugs / unfinished features that you're in the middle of.
This is so we know what to expect if it's labeled as stable.
