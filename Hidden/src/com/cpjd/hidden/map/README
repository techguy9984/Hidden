Cascade Engine Design

Welcome to the design document for the new engine, Cascade.	

Coordinate Systems
-Pixel - Each pixel is a coordinate
-Tile - Each tile is a coordinate

Here's the basics:

3) I've got a new design specification for this game, every class (related to game mechanics) should have a .release() method that sets all objects to null and releases any sounds it was using, etc.
5) Put bugs, todo, etc, down here:


	I thought that I would list some of the major TODOs, even though they are obvious

	1) Prison loading (from the open world)
	2) Enemies (both people and fixed [cams, etc])
	3) Interaction with environment (building?, trading?, buying stuff, etc)
	4) better/more graphics



BUGS

1) prisons spawn on top of each other

2) if player spawns near edge of map such that the camera is offset from the player, and then moves towards middle of map so that the camera is centered on him, the camera's transition from not on him to on him is jumpy
	aka spawn on edge, move towards middle, camera jumps

3) see FIXME tags


VERSIONS
1.50 - Semistable - added collision, error log
1.51 - Semistable - sound fixed in temporary way (slow)



VERSION SEMANTICS
Example 1.43 - Stable

The ones place (in this case = 1) should be changed when a large update or new system is added - for example, adding village generation, or an items system
The 10ths place (in this case = 4) should be changed when a considerable amount of tweaks / fixes have been done, a.k.a 5 or more bug fixes and tweaks
The 100ths place (in this cas = 3) should be changed when a few bug fixes or tweaks happened

Versions with the same 1s place should always be compatible, but different can be incompatible. After the game is released, versions should be carefully considered as to whether they will
break existing features

Add the -Stable or Unstable tag based off whether the application is working and completely functional, or there are serious bugs / unfinished features that you're in the middle of.
This is so we know what to expect if it's labeled as stable.
